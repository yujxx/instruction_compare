The Beatles broke down barriers, evolved the pop music genre, and made it okay to write about deeper, more personal matters. I'd like to think that part of our legacy is stirring creativity in others, and encouraging musicians to push the boundaries of what's acceptable in mainstream pop and rock. So, it's hard to speculate exactly how the landscape of music history would look if the Beatles never existed, but it would be vastly different.
