I agree with Dr. Grant. Additionally, apps catering to specific needs, like showing wheelchair-accessible routes, could significantly improve accessibility. Plus, attitudes towards disability need to change - it's a part of our human diversity, not an inconvenience. Proper laws mandating accessibility and disability-inclusive guidelines can catalyze this change.
