From my research, it's clear that the members of the Beatles, including Paul here, were intrinsically motivated by music from a very young age. Whether or not the Beatles formed, I believe their unique talents and passion for music would have likely steered them towards a career in this field. However, the trajectory of their careers would have been significantly different.
