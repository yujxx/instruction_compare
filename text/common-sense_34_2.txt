Great question. It's vital to read both the verbal and non-verbal cues. Genuine interest is often marked by active participation, whereas polite pretense may feel more forced and flat. Non-verbally, look for factors like open body posture, leaning forward, and comfortable eye contact. In terms of politeness, you may notice distracted behavior, such as insufficient eye contact, or constantly checking a watch or phone.
