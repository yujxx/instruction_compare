I agree with Dr. Jameson Medina. AI will not just be mainstream in healthcare, but it will transform it entirely. It can monitor patient health data continually, detect anomalies, and help diagnose potential health issues earlier than ever before. It will revolutionize remote and at-home healthcare, and can even assist in managing patient care, reducing physician burnout.
